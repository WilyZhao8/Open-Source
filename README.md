# Open-Source Datasets
This project provides datasets and papers related to industrial defect detection from the Pattern Recognition Laboratory and Human-Machine Intelligence Laboratory of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. If you would like to obtain these data for scientific research, please contact Dr. Zhao Wenyi at zwy@bupt.edu.cn.

In order to prevent commercial applications, we only put the corresponding screenshots in the project.
